This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

Just for me, I guess. But I hope it'll be useful to someone else too. It'd be great, but it isn't the only goal of this blog. This is the place where I'm going to post my thoughts, discoveries, and all other ideas that attracted my attention and encouraged me to share them with others. Not necessarily related to coding, work isn't the only interesting area after all! I'll write about anything that will motivate me enough to describe it.

#### But why do I do this?

I believe it's a heavily developing activity. After all, you have to be very careful when writing something widely, because everyone will be able to read your stupid scribbles! Expressing yourself isn't easy, especially when you do it in a foreign language. You have to be really familiar with the topic you are describing and the way how to make it clear and attractive. Anyone can verify your knowledge and ask difficult questions you don't necessarily know the answer to. And that's what it's all about! Criticism is priceless because you can improve yourself and never repeat the same mistake.

#### Who am I?

My name is Marcin, I'm 21 years old. I live in Cracow, Poland. Coding has been my hobby for a long time, but for two years I've been doing it seriously, for over a year commercially as a Frontend Developer. React with TypeScript is my main development direction, but I also experiment with new technologies. I always try to keep the code clean and well tested. I've already learned how important it is! 

I'm also a remote work enthusiast interested in different fields: IT, e-commerce, trading, and fashion. In my free time, I read books, travel, and cook Italian food!

_It was nice to meet you! Stay tuned for more.._
